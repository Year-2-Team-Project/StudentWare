I have uploaded the codes for the social network login. I have heavily edited a few files which include;
+index.php
+modulePage.php
+js/Facebook-Sign.js
+js/Google-Sign.js
+dbConnect.php IMPORTANT NOTE: feel free to change this file!
+twitteroauth/ directory as a whole...


This is primed to run on localhost but all I need to change is change app settings on Google, Twitter and Facebook.
It should then work online...
